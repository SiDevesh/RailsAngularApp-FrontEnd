# RailsAngularApp

This is the AngularJS frontend of a sample app running on Rails 5 --api mode on backend.  
This has full authentication system, and users SHOW and INDEX actions.  
This has full material design UI using the Angular Material library by Google.  
I made this to be used as a starting point for any Rails based Angular app I am designing.  
This uses angular-seed project as starting point.
